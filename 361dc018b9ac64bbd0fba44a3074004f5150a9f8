Did my best to polish, but I have a couple of sticky questions, and it\u0027d be good to get a sense of whether this should go in a totally different direction. (hope not, but we\u0027ll see!)\n\n-------------\n\nTwo questions at the moment for you, Jay:\n\n1. TestRelease/cgo/cgo fails with a very obscure \"could not import C (no metadata for C)\" with this change. I have noooo idea how cgo works, or what\u0027s going on with this error. I did some googling and found a similar question from you in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/36441 with the exact same error. Any idea what\u0027s up with this?\n\n2. When I run `go test`, I consistently get three downloads* - any idea what\u0027s causing that? It\u0027s almost certainly not supposed to be happening. Also makes it hard to work on this without an internet connection. \u003d)\n\n* Specifically:\n\n```\ngo: downloading golang.org/x/mod v0.4.2\ngo: downloading golang.org/x/tools v0.0.0-20200207183749-b753a1ba74fa\ngo: downloading golang.org/x/xerrors v0.0.0-20191011141410-1b5146add898\n```",
