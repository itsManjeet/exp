      "message": "It looks like a lot of resizing will happen here. If you\u0027re concerned about that,\nthen I would convert the linked list to a slice by finding its length and pre-allocating the slice.\n\nHowever, I actually think this whole thing is a premature optimization. Usually there will only be a few vulns, and import chains are rarely very deep. Unless you have performance measurements to the contrary, I would either (a) leave all this code as it is (it\u0027s fine if you prefer to work with linked lists during the BFS) but remove the comment about performance, or (b) try using a slice (ImportChain) and see what happens to code simplicity and performance.\n\nPlease correct me if any of my assumptions are wrong!",
