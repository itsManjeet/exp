      "message": "But that\u0027s because JSON has no way to express binary strings or byte arrays, unlike Go. strconv.Quote has the advantage that if the string is text---or mostly text---then you can still read it. (And if it\u0027s not text, why are you logging it?)\n\nAlso, Go mostly treats byte slice and strings as equivalent. Users of an allocation-conscious logging package might be disappointed at being forced to allocate a string when they have a []byte in hand.",

      "message": "I suppose byte slices arise as bits of opaque matter from other systems (or one\u0027s own). They are rare but do appear: my Zap corpus has them at 0.2% of all attributes.\n\nI think it\u0027s reasonable for TextHandler to write them nicer than\n\n   [64, 88, 128, 45, 51]\n   \nThe human reader is unlikely to be able to make sense of the content (though a log processor might), so something the eye can easily skim over would be nice.\n\nstrconv.Quote assumes the slice is in Unicode, so that []byte{0xCF, 0x80} prints as \"Ï€\". Whether that\u0027s desirable depends on whether one thinks, as you do, that these byte slices are likely to be text. I think they\u0027re unlikely to be.\n\nHow about encoding/hex?",
