      "message": "Thanks for doing this, helped me think a lot.\nI don\u0027t think we can abandon the builder, no exporter tracing gets a lot more expensive if we have to have the event to carry the context to the Start method.\nI also think keeping the immutable thing (Event) delivered to handlers separate from then mutable thing used to build them (Builder) is beneficial in terms of making the API easier to understand and use correctly.\nNot sure builder is the right name, for either the current concept or the more persistent concept you have here. The persistent concept is more like a template, and transient one both builds and delivers the events, so it more than just a builder.\nI do think we need both though, look forward to talking to you later about it.",
