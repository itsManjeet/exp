      "message": "Thanks. Normally I would say maybe we also need to put a require in the root go.mod so that people who do go get winfsnotify also get an x/exp that no longer contains it. But since this is exp I\u0027m not as worried about that. I wonder if the go command should have some logic for that kind of package collision to check whether the latest of both modules would resolve the collision.\n",
