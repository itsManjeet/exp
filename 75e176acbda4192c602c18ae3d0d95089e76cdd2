The \"remember that\" clause seems to indicate that there\u0027s something to remember, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be an explanator clause earlier. Perhaps \"typename is the name of a type\" could be a link somewhere?\n\nWhat does it mean to say that an exported typename is \"new\" if it has the same name?\nIf you mean that it\u0027s an exported typename in the new package, then perhaps \"A new exported typename is compatible with an old one if their types are equivalent\".",

You can see additional discussion in #27858, but here is that particular quote from Bryan in context:\n  https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27858#issuecomment-425089484\n\nOr perhaps I am off base here, but I wanted to at least provide a potentially useful reference.",
