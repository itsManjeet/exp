      "message": "Perhaps my comment is premature or would be more applicable to a different document, but it might be worth mentioning the case of packages moving between modules (especially if \"incompatible\" in this document implies needing to increment the semver major version for a v1 or higher module). See for example some of the discussion in #27858.",
