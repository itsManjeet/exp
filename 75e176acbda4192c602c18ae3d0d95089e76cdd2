      "message": "Perhaps my comment is premature or would be more applicable to a different document, but it might be worth mentioning the case of packages moving between modules (especially if \"incompatible\" in this document implies needing to increment the semver major version for a v1 or higher module). See for example some of the discussion in #27858.",

      "message": "It is not clear to me personally what the final definition will be regarding module compatibility when it involves moving packages between modules, but going back to the #27858 issue I had mentioned, see for example this comment from Bryan: \n\n\"Creating a submodule is not a breaking change as long as the module and submodule have a cyclic requirement.\"\n\nPart of the context there is that creating a submodule often includes moving a package from one module to another module (at least as far as I understand things). You can see additional discussion in #27858, but here is that particular quote from Bryan in context:\n  https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27858#issuecomment-425089484\n\nOr perhaps I am off base here, but I wanted to at least provide a potentially useful reference.",
