      "message": "You might want to invest some neurons in creating CL series in git. If you had 21784 and 21786 as two commits in a single branch and mailed them both from there, gerrit would show this as a diff on the former, and so none of this text would show.\n\nAs a warning though, I found learning how to do it reliably a giant pain. I spent a lot of time trashing branches and cherry-picking CLs into new branches, and then a lot of time getting to know git rebase -i. This git thing is painful.",
