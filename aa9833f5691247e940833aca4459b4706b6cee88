      "message": "With the baseVersion logic factored out, the version argument is now a pass-through parameter: its only role as an input is to appear unmodified in the output.\n\nBut I wonder whether that should still be the case. In prepareLoadDirForLocalModule, we are currently using a synthetic version and replacing it with the actual directory, but perhaps we would get better diagnostics out of subcommands if we used the actual proposed version instead.",

      "message": "Looking at these two `prepare` functions again, I wonder if it would be simpler to combine them.\n\nAs far as I can see, the major differences are:\n\n* Downloaded uses the actual version, while Local uses `vX.0.0-gorelease`.\n\n   * I think we could feasibly use the actual version for both.\n\n* Downloaded emits only a Require directive, while Local emits a Require plus a Replace plus all of the explicit requirements from the go.mod file.\n\n   * Are the duplicated explicit requirements actually necessary? If we omitted them, could we also eliminate the modFile argument from the Local variant?\n\n   * Is the use of fmt.Fprintf vs. a modfile.File only due to the difference in content, or is there a more fundamental reason for it?",
