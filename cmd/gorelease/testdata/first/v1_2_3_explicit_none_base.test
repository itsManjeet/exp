# Is there a way to simulate "no tagged version (in proxy, or remote), but does
# exist in github"? Without the "exists in github" part, `go list -m -versions`
# reports a "no matching versions for query" error. When `go list` does find
# something in github (without versions), on the other hand, it returns the mod
# path without any version.
