I haven\u0027t done a deep dive yet, but I went through the public APIs and they them to be very useful.\n\nQuestion: How soon do you think this package could add support for traces produced by \u003c\u003d go1.21? Once that\u0027s working, I could try to do an experimental integration into our backend to see how well the API will work in a real world application.\n\nAnyway, no pressure, thank you so much for all the work on this!",
