      "message": "\"embeds a Frame\" sounds like an implementation detail as that information doesn\u0027t directly help users since they can\u0027t type assert to a Frame. The only useful way to interact with it is to use Go reflection, and that seems like a clunky API if people are supposed to do that. Perhaps:\n\n // The returned error additionally provides the same method set as Frame.\n // Specifically, it implements Formatter and has a Frame.Location method.\n\nThe later part does bother me though. If access to the location is an important functionality then perhaps it should be a top-level interface?",
