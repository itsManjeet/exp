      "message": "\"embeds a Frame\" sounds like an implementation detail as that information doesn\u0027t directly help users since they can\u0027t type assert to a Frame. The only useful way to interact with it is to use Go reflection, and that seems like a clunky API if people are supposed to do that. Perhaps:\n\n // The returned error additionally provides the same method set as Frame.\n // Specifically, it implements Formatter and has a Frame.Location method.\n\nThe later part does bother me though. If access to the location is an important functionality then perhaps it should be a top-level interface?",

      "message": "The reason for this wording is that I wanted to keep it short. I prefer not to expose a Locationer interface and I do not want to mention the signature of the function. \n\nI like your wording, and it would achieve the same, if it were true: the returned error does not implement the same method set (Frame does not implement errors.Formatter).\n\nI\u0027m fine with removing exposing the method for now until people demand it. \nWording-wise, I can live with:\n\n// The returned error records the callers frame. It exposes this frame\u0027s\n// Location method and implements Formatter to print the location in the\n// error details.\n\nWould that work?",

      "message": "Frame is an implementation detail.\n\nWe\u0027ve got an existing way to talk about the method set of a type: We say what interfaces it implements. So I\u0027d say \"the returned error implements Formatter and Locationer\". If we don\u0027t want to expose a Locationer interface, perhaps that means errors shouldn\u0027t have a Location method.\n\nA possible alternative to defining specific interfaces for each additional method might be:\n\n// All errors returned by this package implement Error.\ntype Error interface {\n  Formatter\n  Location() (function, file string, line int)\n\n  // Unexported method to prevent implementation by other packages.\n  //\n  // Including this method allows additional methods to be added to this\n  // interface in the future.\n  internal()\n}",
