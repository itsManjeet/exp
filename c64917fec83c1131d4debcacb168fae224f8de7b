      "message": "\"embeds a Frame\" sounds like an implementation detail as that information doesn\u0027t directly help users since they can\u0027t type assert to a Frame. The only useful way to interact with it is to use Go reflection, and that seems like a clunky API if people are supposed to do that. Perhaps:\n\n // The returned error additionally provides the same method set as Frame.\n // Specifically, it implements Formatter and has a Frame.Location method.\n\nThe later part does bother me though. If access to the location is an important functionality then perhaps it should be a top-level interface?",

      "message": "The reason for this wording is that I wanted to keep it short. I prefer not to expose a Locationer interface and I do not want to mention the signature of the function. \n\nI like your wording, and it would achieve the same, if it were true: the returned error does not implement the same method set (Frame does not implement errors.Formatter).\n\nI\u0027m fine with removing exposing the method for now until people demand it. \nWording-wise, I can live with:\n\n// The returned error records the callers frame. It exposes this frame\u0027s\n// Location method and implements Formatter to print the location in the\n// error details.\n\nWould that work?",
