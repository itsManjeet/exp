      "message": "When comparing packages in two distinct modules, what happens if a package imports an internal package and returns a type from there? It\u0027s not a compatible difference, but warning about that may be different because separate modules aren\u0027t usually expected to be compatible.\n\nThere isn\u0027t an obvious right answer here, but we should decide the behavior we want, test it, and document it.",

      "message": "TestRelease/internalcompat/internalcompat now tests this.\n\nIt looks like apidiff does not report a difference between the corresponding internal types of a definition in a non-internal package. I think that\u0027s the right behavior. If it did report a difference, I think we would need to suppress that since those differences aren\u0027t going to be interesting to anyone comparing forks or major versions.",
