Using the Location method it would still be trivial to include frame info in the non-detail section if this is desired.\n\nI agree it may be surprising, but would you still favor not calling the detail here? Perhaps we use a different name, like FormatDetail?\n\nIn this case there is, I believe, an obvious right thing to do and I want to eliminate the possibility for error there as much as possible.",
