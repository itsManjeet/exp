      "message": "How big do Frames get?\n\nIf a Frame is only meant to be slightly larger than the screen, and it\u0027s the job of some other code to map subsets of files into a frame as it is scrolled, then storing the text as a []byte may work. (Though it\u0027s going to have to get pretty clever to avoid lots of big allocations when scrolling up.)\n\nBut if a Frame is meant to hold files that could reasonably be loaded into memory(~10MBs) then []byte isn\u0027t going to work with edits. Inserting text at the top of a Frame is going to get slow if each event copies hundreds of MB around in memory.\n\nIf it\u0027s the former, there should probably be a note in the comments. If it\u0027s the latter, how about a TODO on the text field referencing other data structures (like a gap buffer, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer).",
