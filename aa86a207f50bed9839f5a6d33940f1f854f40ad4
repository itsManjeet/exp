      "message": "Be careful of taking w.mu here. The rest of this method does a number of glctx calls, for which progress relies on a goroutine elsewhere selecting on WorkAvailable and calling DoWork. If that other goroutine is e.g. processing X11 events in the processEvents function, it might be processing a resize event, that will want to take w.mu to write to its sz field: deadlock.\n\nInstead, I think that we need separate per-Window mutexes for GL related things and for other things.",
