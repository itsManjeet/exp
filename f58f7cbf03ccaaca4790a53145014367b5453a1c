      "message": "I was playing with a similar approach amongst others last night.\nI ended up settling on using types rather than values for the Kinds, because it leaves you with a single typeswitch to detect the kind (as you have to do that for string)\nIt also means that the invalid or default Value is the only one with a nil untyped.\nI was also using the fact that we know the underlying packed type to remove the need for the dispatcher and radically simplify the printer, which mostly works. There is a small downside where things like the severity can either be packed as an int but will print as one, or put in untyped and print as a string, but not both. I can\u0027t decide if that matters or not.",
