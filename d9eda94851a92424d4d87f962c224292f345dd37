      "message": "This is a convenience method, no? (You can Upload a buffer into a texture, and then Copy it onto the window.)\n\nAs such, how about making it a package function. By default it does the long path through an ephemeral texture, but it can look to see if the given window value implements a method like this, and use it as a fast path.\n\n(My motivation here is the Window type has a lot of methods, and I\u0027d like to shrink it if possible.)",

      "message": "Is this motivated by X11 in some way? Because I don\u0027t understand tying these events to a window in terms of the underlying graphics systems on modern machines.\n\nA Texture represents a piece of graphics memory. Operations like Scale or Transform are done on or between pieces of graphics memory, so I would expect these to be methods on a texture.\n\nBesides the fact this doesn\u0027t fit with the way the underlying systems work, this is conceptually limiting. I would like to be able to upload a Buffer into a Texture, do transformations on it and then Download it. (The GPU has a couple of orders of magnitude on CPU implementations of Scale and Transform.) Forcing it onto the screen is limiting.",
