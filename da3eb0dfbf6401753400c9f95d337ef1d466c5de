      "message": "Will there be enough shared driver machinery to justify a driverutil package? It would be nice to keep driver details as far away from the screen docs as possible.\n\n(At some point a lot of the cocoa code should split out from the gldriver package, and maybe a bunch of the windriver code too, which could be used by the gldriver package to implement a GL-on-win32 backend. But I\u0027m not sure where those packages should go.)",
