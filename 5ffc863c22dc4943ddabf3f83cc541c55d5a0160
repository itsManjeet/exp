But did we say we would stop promising to preserve attributes\u0027 \"listness\" even in the Logger  \u003c-\u003e Handler interface? I don\u0027t recall.",

I think the particular example was removing trace/span information from the list.\nIn general, Handlers should not be required to preserve anything about the Attrs (or at least, I don\u0027t know how to formulate a minimum requirement), although our built-in ones preserve order and don\u0027t remove anything.",
