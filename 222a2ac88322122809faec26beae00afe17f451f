      "message": "The Code is a USB HID code. It is intended to be a platform-independent way to map key position. Almost always, a USB HID code corresponds to the \"obvious\" key on a US keyboard. Take a look at convVirtualKeyCode in app/darwin_amd64.go (and convAndroidKeyCode in cl/13678).\n\nThe Rune should be a unicode rune adjusted from the keyboard code by the operating system. It may be entirely different than the code, depending on what key map the user has loaded.",
