      "message": "All this indexing is a bit difficult for me to follow.\n\nCould we make loadPackages return a map rather than a slice, and then sort the keys of the map(s) (in the usual way) to produce a combined slice to iterate over? I realize that\u0027s O(N log N) rather than O(N), but N is small here and it would be easier for my brain to process in manageable chunks.\n\nBarring that, could we at least split this into a section of “zip the two lists of packages pairwise” and, separately, “diff the packages in the pairwise list”?",
