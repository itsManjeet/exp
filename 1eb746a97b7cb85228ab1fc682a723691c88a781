      "message": "Yeah, this was the original API. It got changed because I was trying to keep it consistent, but I think that is not the right way to go and we should return to this\nIt does cause an extra allocation, but Start already does a few allocations, so one more is probably not an issue. Anybody wanting a low overhead call will need to generate the event and deliver it without creating a context.\nI think we should remove Builder.End as well though.\nThe other problem is it is hard to build a start event with extra labels right now, I think Start should also take a ...Label and have a WithAll call. If people use it, it will also cause allocations, but my previous argument about allocations holds for this as well.",
