Is that your intention?\n\nWhatever your answer to my question is, perhaps, this should be documented.",

      "message": "The empty title as zero value is indeed intentional. Before, window titles were driver-specific: empty, process name, \"App\" and \"Shiny Window\".\nI therefore tried to establish a useful, consistent behaviour when the newWindow is passed the zero value - an empty title seemed most appropriate.\n\nYou are certainly right about the documentation part. I will push a new patch set with an amended comment.",
