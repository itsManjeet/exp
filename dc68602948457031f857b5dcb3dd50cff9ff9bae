      "message": "Not a change for this cl, but to start a conversation:\n\nI was thinking of having these as a special typed int using bitflags with getters and setters, so that we could have a method on a handler to return the ones it accepted.\nThat would allow us to have a handler set the defaults, and the user to override them somehow, although I have not fully thought it through. It would also allow delegating handlers to union the flags from their children, and to use those flags to direct events to appropriate children. It also allows a handler that wants everything to easily use the all on bitflag form.",
